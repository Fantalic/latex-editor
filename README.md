# Super Simple Latex Editor

This is a fun hackable collaborative latex editor with [Yjs](y-js.org). The idea is to make the editor, and its code very approachable for any developer. It has a nice Rest API, and a built-in directory explorer.

```
npm i -g latex-editor
# navigate to your latex project
latex-editor
```

There are a million things you can do with this thing. This could be a first step to take down overleaf - who knows?
